Project Overview
Taiwan faces frequent landslides and debris flows due to extreme weather and its unique geographic setting, often obstructing railways and highways.Relying only on cameras and AI image recognition has proven unreliable, particularly during heavy rainfall, which often leads to numerous false alarms. Radar technology provides a more robust solution. Unlike optical cameras, radar can operate under poor lighting and severe weather. By using FMCW radar with phased-array beamforming, the system enables wide-area, real-time monitoring and detects moving hazards such as falling rocks or debris flows. With IoT-enabled deployment and edge computing, it ensures timely warnings even under network disruptions, enhancing road and railway safety.
